# Close Duplicate Tab (Manifest V3)

🚫🧪 Chrome recently disabled support for legacy extensions using Manifest V2 — including the once-popular ["Close Duplicate Tab"](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/close-duplicate-tab/lccfnphpgnpeghoffocbacbkohbapinm), which hadn’t been updated since 2020.

✅ This is a **community-maintained, working version** of the original extension, fully updated to support **Manifest V3** and **modern Chrome APIs**.

## 🔍 What it does

This extension helps you keep your browser clean by:

- Automatically detecting **duplicate tabs** (same URL)
- Closing older or less important duplicates
- Displaying a badge with the number of duplicates
- Optionally sorting tabs by URL
- Showing tab and domain statistics in the tooltip

## 📦 Why this exists

The original extension from the Chrome Web Store stopped working in mid-2025, when Chrome removed the ability to enable deprecated Manifest V2 extensions.

I took the original ZIP source, reverse-engineered and fixed it to work under **Manifest V3**.
